# Progress

## What Works

- Real-time audio recording in browser using MediaRecorder.
- Audio Blobs sent directly to backend via WebSocket (no JSON).
- Audio folder now only contains AudioRecordingService.js and AudioPlaybackService.js (no worklets).
- App component is present in src/frontend/App.jsx and is the root entry; Scene.jsx is main Three.js component.
- Backend proxies audio to Deepgram using official SDK.
- Deepgram transcriptions received and displayed in frontend.
- Robust connection management and error handling.
- Groq integration implemented for processing transcriptions and streaming complete sentences.
- Short-term memory implemented in the GroqService using Langchain's ConversationSummaryBufferMemory with the `llama3-8b-8192` model for summarization. The prompt structure has been corrected to use `MessagesPlaceholder` for chat history.
- All Gemini code fully removed.

## What's Left to Build

- UI/UX improvements for displaying and interacting with transcriptions.
- Additional AI provider support (future).
- More comprehensive testing (edge cases, error states).
- Deployment and scaling documentation.

## Current Status

- Deepgram streaming integration is stable and production-ready.
- All audio and transcript flows are event-driven and robust.
- Project documentation and memory bank are up to date.

## Known Issues

- No major issues at this time.
- Further testing needed for rare browser/connection edge cases.
