# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Barreiros ThreeAI addresses the need for seamless, real-time voice interaction in web-based 3D environments. It enables users to communicate naturally using speech, with instant transcription and feedback, enhancing accessibility and interactivity.

## Problems Solved

- Eliminates the friction of text input in immersive 3D applications.
- Provides accurate, low-latency speech-to-text using Deepgram.
- Bridges the gap between real-time audio and AI-driven interfaces.
- Lays the foundation for future multimodal AI integrations.

## How It Should Work

- Users interact with a 3D scene rendered in the browser.
- Pressing a button starts audio recording via MediaRecorder.
- Audio is streamed to the backend and proxied to Deepgram.
- Transcriptions are displayed in real time in the UI.
- The system is responsive, robust, and easy to use.

## User Experience Goals

- Instant feedback: transcriptions appear as the user speaks.
- Minimal latency and high reliability.
- Clean, modern UI with clear controls.
- Extensible for future AI and 3D features.
