# Project Brief

Barreiros ThreeAI is a full-stack web application that combines 3D visualization (Three.js), real-time audio streaming, and AI-powered speech-to-text using Deepgram. The project enables users to interact with a 3D scene and communicate via voice, with all audio transcribed in real time.

## Core Requirements

- Real-time audio recording in the browser and streaming to the backend.
- Backend proxies audio to Deepgram's streaming API for live transcription.
- Transcriptions are sent back to the client and displayed.
- Modular, scalable architecture for future AI integrations.
- Modern, responsive UI with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Robust error handling and clear separation of concerns.

## Goals

- Provide a seamless, low-latency voice-to-text experience.
- Maintain a clean, maintainable codebase with clear documentation.
- Support future expansion to other AI providers or features.
